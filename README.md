# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi there! I'm Reem, and I'm passionate about VR development, game development, software testing, machine learning, and data science. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you'll find a collection of my projects. 

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

I'm a biomedical engineer and have worked on multiple projects in the tech industry.
</br>
I'm currently working on a cognitive training program designed to aid the workforce in enhancing their attentional skills. 
</br>
I enjoy software testing and believe in the importance of delivering applications that provide a smooth experience for users and exceed their expectations. 

## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Attention Training Virtual Reality Game 🧠🎮
- Description: an attention training program designed to aid the workforce in accessibly training their selective, distributed, and sustained attention
- Technologies: Unity3D, C#, Oculus SDK

### Tessera: a ticket booking platform 🎟️📝

- Description: Tessera is a clone of the popular ticketing platform, eventbrite. I collaborated with a large team to build this product as a software tester, testing the web app as well as the mobile app
- Technologies: Java
- Repository: [Tessera Integration Testing](https://github.com/ReemYasser2/tessera-integration-testing)

### Retinal Image Classification 👁️🖼️

- Description: In this project, I explore the application of computer vision algorithms in the classification of retinal images to aid in the diagnosis of retinal diseases
- Technologies: Python
- Repository: [Three-class retinal image classification](https://github.com/ReemYasser2/Three-class-retinal-image-classification)

### Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳📊

- Description: This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing large datasets. I applied various data science techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from valid ones and presented them through interactive visualizations.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Repository: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/ReemYasser2/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

### Cardiovascular Disease Classification ❤️📈

- Description: In this project, we used logistic regression to classify how likely patients were to have cardiovascular disease according to several vitals, biological factors, and metrics. 
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Repository: [Cardiovascular Disease Classifier](https://github.com/ReemYasser2/Cardiovascular-disease-classifier)

### Retinal Image Classification 👁️🖼️

- Description: In this project, I demonstrate several integral image processing concepts and techniques using an interactable desktop application that allows users to open and manipulate images of any type.
- Technologies: Python
- Repository: [Image Processing Application](https://github.com/ReemYasser2/Image-Processing-Application)

Feel free to explore these projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from others.
