<h2> :wave: Hi, I'm Reem </h2>

I'm a biomedical engineering student at Cairo University.
I'm interested in VR development, game development, software testing, machine learning, and data science. 
</br>
</br>

Iâ€™m currently working on cognitive training solutions developed for VR.
</br>
I enjoy software testing, especially when it comes to web and mobile apps.
